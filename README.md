# WordleClone
A clone of the Wordle game built in React
This clone was done following Pedro Machaca's (PedroTech from YouTube) tutorial
I resovlved two bugs with the game. The first being that after adding the random word, the game would not alert the player they won.
The second was that if the play won on the final attempt it would not count their victory but would still show the lost screen.
I also incorperated a larger library to reference when playing, added a new alert for when a word is not in the library using the SweetAlert library.
Added and modified the CSS file to make the site more responsive and made the site auto refresh after the match was over to restart the game.
